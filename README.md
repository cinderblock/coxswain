Daemon to handle deployments from push events.

## Development

### Prerequisites

[**Node 8+**](https://nodejs.org/en/download) must be installed on your development system.

```bash
npm install
```

### Running

To run this full system, **two** separate programs need to be run.
One for the web **UI** and one to actually do something persistent, the **daemon**.

Most commands are intended to be run **on your development machine** and **not** directly on the remote system.

## Cheat sheet

All of these are run from the top level directory.
